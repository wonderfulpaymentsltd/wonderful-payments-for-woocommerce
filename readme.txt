Instant payments, with purpose. Accept slick, secure bank payments from UK accounts, whilst slashing fees and supporting wonderful causes!

== Description ==

###Instant payments that give back

The Wonderful Payments plugin for UK WooCommerce stores allows merchants to receive slick, instant bank payments from customers, whilst **slashing** transaction fees, removing friction at the checkout and improving security.

What’s more, by simply sending and receiving payments with Wonderful, you and your customers support thousands of UK charities **at no additional cost**!

Wonderful sits neatly alongside other payment methods on your WooCommerce checkout, introducing a simple, fast, secure payment option where funds settle instantly in your merchant account.

###We've only gone and done it: 1p per transaction!

Instead of charging 1-3% + 20p or more on every sale you make, Wonderful offers an incredibly aggressive pricing model: £9.99 per month, for up to 1,000 transactions. Any transactions over this amount are also charged at 1p and invoiced separately. You can expect to save at least 78% compared to credit and debit card payments, and even more compared to many other popular payment gateways.

###Delight your customers

Wonderful’s innovative payment technology introduces a new, vastly improved payment experience. When it’s time to pay, instead of asking for card details or digital wallet logins from your customers Wonderful simply asks them to select their bank and automatically connects them to the mobile banking app they know and trust, where they can approve a pre-populated, instant payment.

1. Your customer selects their bank.
2. Wonderful seamlessly connects your customer to their mobile banking app.
3. With a couple of taps, your customer authorises a direct, secure payment to your merchant account.

Every transaction benefits from secure authorisation at the bank. No sort codes, account numbers, long card numbers or passwords to enter. Once the payment has been authorised, Wonderful quickly redirects the customer back to your WooCommerce for order confirmation.

###Why Wonderful?

Not only do Wonderful payments delight customers, eliminate card processing fees and make payments safer, they allow shoppers and merchants to give back to good causes, simply by sending and receiving payments. Since 2016, Wonderful has operated the much loved charity fundraising platform, [Wonderful.org](https://wonderful.org), which provides unlimited donation processing to UK charities at no cost whatsoever. It’s how we got started, and it’s what makes us wonderful! So, whether you’re running a marathon for charity or just selling the trainers, Wonderful makes giving a little easier for everyone.
